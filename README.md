Determine whether to send a direct mail piece to a customer

Problem Description:
Springleaf puts the humanity back into lending by offering their customers personal and auto loans that help them take control of their lives and their finances. Direct mail is one important way Springleaf's team can connect with customers whom may be in need of a loan.
Direct offers provide huge value to customers who need them, and are a fundamental part of Springleaf's marketing strategy. In order to improve their targeted efforts, Springleaf must be sure they are focusing on the customers who are likely to respond and be good candidates for their services.

Using a large set of anonymized features, Springleaf is asking you to predict which customers will respond to a direct mail offer. You are challenged to construct new meta-variables and employ feature-selection methods to approach this dauntingly wide dataset.
