## About the data:
You are provided a high-dimensional dataset of anonymized customer information. Each row corresponds to one customer. The response variable is binary and labeled "target". You must predict the target variable for every row in the test set.

The features have been anonymized to protect privacy and are comprised of a mix of continuous and categorical features. You will encounter many "placeholder" values in the data, which represent cases such as missing values. We have intentionally preserved their encoding to match with internal systems at Springleaf. The meaning of the features, their values, and their types are provided "as-is" for this competition; handling a huge number of messy features is part of the challenge here.

##Problem Description:
Springleaf puts the humanity back into lending by offering their customers personal and auto loans that help them take control of their lives and their finances. Direct mail is one important way Springleaf's team can connect with customers whom may be in need of a loan.
Direct offers provide huge value to customers who need them, and are a fundamental part of Springleaf's marketing strategy. In order to improve their targeted efforts, Springleaf must be sure they are focusing on the customers who are likely to respond and be good candidates for their services.

Using a large set of anonymized features, Springleaf is asking you to predict which customers will respond to a direct mail offer. You are challenged to construct new meta-variables and employ feature-selection methods to approach this dauntingly wide dataset.

##Hardware resources:
Can utilize the Script section of Kaggle , since there is a memory limit, the model can only be built on a sample of data. for more details look at https://www.kaggle.com/c/springleaf-marketing-response/scripts
